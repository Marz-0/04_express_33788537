# MyPage

This is a basic node.js web application that show's some information about me.

The links.txt file shows the web links to my website that can be accessed by any device.

This is running on the goldsmiths virtual servers. 

If users entered /contact or /about at the end of the URL, they will be directed to a different page on my application.
